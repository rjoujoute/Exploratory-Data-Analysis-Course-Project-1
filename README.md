==========================================
### Exploratory Data Analysis 
  This is my repo for Course Project 1. I have 8 files. 4 png files and 4 R script files. In order to run this script, download the data from, 
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip. 
  Then extract the data into your working directory, and then download the r scripts to obtain the plots.
